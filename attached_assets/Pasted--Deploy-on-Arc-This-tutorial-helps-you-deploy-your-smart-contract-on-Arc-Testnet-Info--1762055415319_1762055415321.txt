# Deploy on Arc

> This tutorial helps you deploy your smart contract on Arc Testnet

<Info>
  Arc is currently in its testnet phase. During this period, the network may
  experience instability or unplanned downtime. **Note:** Throughout this page,
  all references to Arc refer specifically to the Arc Testnet.
</Info>

In this tutorial, you'll use Solidity and Foundry to write, deploy, and interact
with a simple smart contract on the Arc Testnet.

## What you'll learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

* Set up your development environment
* Configure Foundry to connect with Arc
* Implement your smart contract
* Deploy your contract to Arc Testnet
* Interact with your deployed contract

## Set up your development environment

Before you deploy to Arc, you need a working development environment. In this
step, you install [**Foundry**](https://getfoundry.sh/), a portable Ethereum
development toolkit, and initialize a new Solidity project.

1. Install Development Tools

```shell  theme={null}
# Download foundry installer `foundryup`
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

2. Install binaries

```shell  theme={null}
# Install forge, cast, anvil, chisel
foundryup
```

3. Initialize a new Solidity Project

```shell  theme={null}
forge init hello-arc && cd hello-arc
```

## Configure Foundry to interact with Arc

In this step, you set up Foundry to connect to the Arc network by adding Arc's
RPC URLs to your project environment.

1. Create a `.env` file

Open the `hello-arc` project in your preferred code editor (for example, **VS
Code**). Then, create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project
directory.

2. Add the Arc Testnet RPC URL

Paste the following environment variable into the `.env` file:

```ini  theme={null}
ARC_TESTNET_RPC_URL="https://rpc.testnet.arc.network"
```

This URL allows Foundry to connect to the Arc Testnet.

<Tip>
  Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Store private keys and
  sensitive variables securely.
</Tip>

## Implement your smart contract

In this step, you create the **HelloArchitect** contract, update the test and
script files, and compile the project.

<Info>
  **HelloArchitect** is a simple storage contract that manages a greeting
  message: it starts with a default greeting, lets you update it, and emits an
  event whenever the greeting changes.
</Info>

### 1. Write the HelloArchitect contract

First, delete the default `Counter.sol` template file from the `/src` directory:

```shell  theme={null}
rm src/Counter.sol
```

Next, create a new file named `HelloArchitect.sol` inside the `/src` directory,
and add the following code:

```js  theme={null}
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

contract HelloArchitect {
    string private greeting;

    // Event emitted when the greeting is changed
    event GreetingChanged(string newGreeting);

    // Constructor that sets the initial greeting to "Hello Architect!"
    constructor() {
        greeting = "Hello Architect!";
    }

    // Setter function to update the greeting
    function setGreeting(string memory newGreeting) public {
        greeting = newGreeting;
        emit GreetingChanged(newGreeting);
    }

    // Getter function to return the current greeting
    function getGreeting() public view returns (string memory) {
        return greeting;
    }
}
```

This contract includes a private `greeting` variable that stores the greeting
string, along with two public functions:

* `setGreeting` updates the `greeting` value and emits the `GreetingChanged`
  event
* `getGreeting` returns the current value of `greeting`

### 2. Update scripts and tests

Since you deleted `Counter.sol`, you need to remove or replace any scripts and
tests that reference it to avoid compilation errors.

**Delete the `script` directory**

The `script` directory includes files that reference `Counter.sol`. Since you've
removed `Counter.sol`, delete the entire `script` directory to avoid compilation
errors:

```shell  theme={null}
rm -rf script
```

<Tip>
  You can recreate this directory later with updated deployment scripts for your
  own contracts.
</Tip>

**Replace `Counter.t.sol` with `HelloArchitect.t.sol`**

Navigate to the `/test` directory, delete the existing `Counter.t.sol` file, and
create a new test file named `HelloArchitect.t.sol`. Then, add the following
test cases to validate your contract:

```js  theme={null}
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../src/HelloArchitect.sol";

contract HelloArchitectTest is Test {
    HelloArchitect helloArchitect;

    function setUp() public {
        helloArchitect = new HelloArchitect();
    }

    function testInitialGreeting() public view {
        string memory expected = "Hello Architect!";
        string memory actual = helloArchitect.getGreeting();
        assertEq(actual, expected);
    }

    function testSetGreeting() public {
        string memory newGreeting = "Welcome to Arc Chain!";
        helloArchitect.setGreeting(newGreeting);
        string memory actual = helloArchitect.getGreeting();
        assertEq(actual, newGreeting);
    }

    function testGreetingChangedEvent() public {
        string memory newGreeting = "Building on Arc!";

        // Expect the GreetingChanged event to be emitted
        vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
        emit HelloArchitect.GreetingChanged(newGreeting);

        helloArchitect.setGreeting(newGreeting);
    }
}
```

### 3. Test the contract

Run the following command to execute the contract's unit tests locally:

```shell  theme={null}
forge test
```

This will compile the project, run the tests defined in `HelloArchitect.t.sol`,
and display the results in your terminal.

### 4. Compile the contract

To compile the **HelloArchitect** contract and generate build artifacts, run:

```shell  theme={null}
forge build
```

This creates the `/out` directory containing the compiled bytecode and ABI,
which you'll use when deploying the contract.

## Deploy your contract to Arc Testnet

In this step, you generate a wallet, fund it with testnet USDC (Arc's native gas
token), and deploy your smart contract to the Arc Testnet using Foundry.

### 1. Generate a wallet

To deploy the **HelloArchitect** contract, you need a funded wallet. Use the
Foundry command-line tool to generate a new wallet:

```shell  theme={null}
cast wallet new
```

The command generates a new keypair and returns output similar to the following:

```
Successfully created new keypair.
Address:     0xB815A0c4bC23930119324d4359dB65e27A846A2d
Private key: 0xcc1b30a6af68ea9a9917f1dd••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••97c5
```

<Warning>
  **Important:** Keep your private key secure. Never share it or commit it to
  source control.
</Warning>

Add your private key to your `.env` file:

```ini  theme={null}
PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
```

Reload your environment variables:

```shell  theme={null}
source .env
```

### 2. Fund your wallet

Visit [https://faucet.circle.com](https://faucet.circle.com), select **Arc Testnet**, paste your wallet
address, and request testnet USDC.

Since USDC is Arc's native gas token, this will provide the funds needed to
cover gas fees when deploying your contract.

<Info>
  Testnet USDC is for testing purposes only. It has no real-world value and must
  not be used in production.
</Info>

### 3. Deploy the contract

With your wallet funded with testnet USDC, deploy the **HelloArchitect**
contract to the Arc Testnet using the Foundry command-line tool:

```shell  theme={null}
forge create src/HelloArchitect.sol:HelloArchitect \
  --rpc-url $ARC_TESTNET_RPC_URL \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --broadcast
```

<Warning>
  **Important:** Never expose your real private key in production. Use
  environment variables or secrets management in real deployments.
</Warning>

After the contract is deployed successfully, you should see output similar to
this:

```
Compiler run successful!
Deployer: 0xB815A0c4bC23930119324d4359dB65e27A846A2d
Deployed to: 0x32368037b14819C9e5Dbe96b3d67C59b8c65c4BF
Transaction hash: 0xeba0fcb5e528d586db0aeb2465a8fad0299330a9773ca62818a1827560a67346
```

### 4. Store the contract address

Copy the deployed contract address from the `Deployed to:` line and save it to
your `.env` file:

```ini  theme={null}
HELLOARCHITECT_ADDRESS="0x..."
```

Reload your environment variables again:

```shell  theme={null}
source .env
```

## Interact with your deployed contract

In this step, you verify that the deployment succeeded by checking the
transaction in the Arc Testnet Explorer, then use `cast` to call a function from
your contract.

### 1. Check transaction on the explorer

Open the [Arc Testnet Explorer](https://testnet.arcscan.app), and paste the
**transaction hash** from the deployment output. This lets you view the
transaction details and confirm that the contract was deployed successfully.

### 2. Use `cast` to call a contract function

Use the `cast call` command to interact with your deployed contract from the
command line. Run the following:

```shell  theme={null}
cast call $HELLOARCHITECT_ADDRESS "getGreeting()(string)" \
  --rpc-url $ARC_TESTNET_RPC_URL
```

The command calls the `getGreeting` function on the **HelloArchitect** contract
and returns the current value of the `greeting` variable.

## Next steps

Congratulations, you've deployed and interacted with your first contract on Arc
Testnet. From here, you can:

* Extend the **HelloArchitect** contract with more logic for additional
  features.
* Explore Arc's stablecoin-native features like USDC as gas and deterministic
  finality
* Build more advanced applications for payments, FX, or tokenized assets
