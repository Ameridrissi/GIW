1.1 Clarify Core Features
Multi-card & USDC Integration: Allow users to connect multiple payment options (cards and USDC wallets) and use USDC for blockchain payments.
AI-Powered Spending Insights: Analyze user spending data and provide budget advice and spending alerts.
Smart Automation: Enable features like recurring payments, bill splitting, and AI recommendations for payment methods.
Partner Integrations (Optional): Connect with merchant APIs (Airbnb, Uber, etc.) for rewards or cashback.
1.2 Design Basic Architecture
Frontend (React):
User interface for /login/sign up .
Home for application information and blockchain news
Bttomn for wallet creation+card
Payment dashboard showing linked cards & USDC balances.
Spending insights and budgeting visualization.
Automation controls (setup recurring payments, split bills).
Backend (Node.js):
REST API  to manage user data and AI analytics.
Wallet management using provider SDKs (e.g., Circle Wallets).
Blockchain communication layer interacting with Arc via SDK or smart contracts.
AI services integration to process spending data and generate insights.
Blockchain Layer:
Arc blockchain smart contracts for payment handling.
USDC token contract for transactions.
Use of account abstraction tools for wallet onboarding and transaction signing.
1.3 Outline API / Data Flow (High Level)
User logs in or creates wallet (frontend calls backend).
Backend manages wallet creation or links existing wallets via SDK.
User makes payments or sets up automation (frontend → backend → blockchain).
Backend collects payment history and transmits data to AI/ML API.
AI/ML API returns spending insights to backend.
Backend serves AI insights to frontend dashboard.
If automation triggers are set, backend initiates blockchain transactions autonomously.
